### About
Erik was an early employee at Prometheus Biosciences (`$RXDX`), a biotech company bringing precision medicine to autoimmune disease. At Prometheus, he built and led the Data Science & Engineering (DSE) team. DSE developed a suite of curated data assets, bioinformatics pipelines, and machine learning methods to enable therapeutic discovery and companion diagnostic development.

Before joining Prometheus, Erik completed postdoctoral training at Mass General, MIT, and the Broad Institute developing deep learning approaches to phenotype patients using high-resolution physiological time series data. He also evaluated early-stage investment opportunities at Takeda Ventures with a focus on data science and drug discovery.

Erik received an MD from Emory University and a PhD in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Statistics from Georgia Institute of Technology where he published and patented signal processing and machine learning methods applied to physiological data. He also co-founded Forge Health, a non-profit that provided startups with funding, mentors, and assistance starting clinical pilots at Emory Healthcare and the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Erik received his undergraduate degree from UCLA in bioengineering with focuses in computer science and chemical engineering. At UCLA he published research on cell behavior in biomaterials.
