### About
Erik was an early employee at Prometheus Biosciences (`$RXDX`), a biotech company bringing precision medicine to autoimmune disease. At Prometheus, he was the founding Director of Data Science & Engineering. His team curated multimodal data, built bioinformatics pipelines, and implemented machine learning (ML) methods to enable target validation and companion diagnostic (CDx) development. These efforts supported a successful phase 2 clinical trial in ulcerative colitis, an IND for a novel therapeutic candidate and CDx algorithm, and indication expansion activities. Erik also contributed to a patent on predicting treatment response to anti-IL12/IL-23 therapy from genetic data.

Before Prometheus, Erik completed postdoctoral training at Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and the Broad Institute where he developed deep learning approaches to predict cardiovascular disease outcomes from physiological data. He also evaluated computational drug discovery startups at Takeda Ventures.

Erik received an MD from Emory University and a PhD in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Statistics from Georgia Institute of Technology where he published and patented signal processing and ML methods. He also co-founded Forge Health, a non-profit that provided startups with funding, mentors, and assistance starting clinical pilots at Emory Healthcare and the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Originally from Los Angeles, Erik graduated from UCLA with a B.S. (honors) in Bioengineering.

Outside of work, Erik enjoys pickleball, bouldering, and traveling.
