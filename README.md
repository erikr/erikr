### Now

🧬 I am the Director of Data Science & Engineering at [Prometheus Biosciences](https://www.prometheusbiosciences.com).

🚀 I work with data scientists, software engineers, biologists, and clinicians to advance precision medicine using data and compute.

### Previously
- 📊 postdoc at Mass General, MIT, and the Broad Institute
- 💡 intern at Takeda Ventures
- 🤝 cofounder at Forge
- 🏥 MD from Emory
- 💻 PhD in biomedical engineering & statistics from Georgia Tech
- 🏄🏻‍♂️ BS in bioengineering from UCLA

### Tech
I completed my postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Systems Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital, Computational Cardiovascular Research Group at MIT, and Machine Learning for Health initiative at the Broad Institute. I curated multimodal biomedical data, developed ML infrastructure, and trained models to predict clinical outcomes from EMR data and ECGs.

I obtained my PhD in Biomedical Engineering and Statistics at Georgia Tech where I worked on signal processing and ML applied to physiological and behavioral data. We patented and licensed some of this work.

Earlier, I studied Bioengineering at UCLA, after starting in computer science, and minored in chemical engineering. I developed cellularized fibrin hydrogels for dermal wound healing, nanoparticles for imaging cells, and computational diffusion-reaction models of oxygen transport and cell growth.
