### About
Erik was an early employee at Prometheus Biosciences (`$RXDX`), a biotech company bringing precision medicine to autoimmune disease. At Prometheus, he was the founding Director of Data Science & Engineering, and was responsible for the company's vision and strategy around multimodal data curation, bioinformatics pipelines, and machine learning. His team supported a successful phase 2 clinical trial in inflammatory bowel disease, an IND application for a novel therapeutic candidate, the refinement of a clinical-stage CDx algorithm, and indication expansion activities. Erik also contributed to a patent on predicting treatment response to anti-IL12/IL-23 therapy from genetic data.

Before Prometheus, Erik completed postdoctoral training at Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and the Broad Institute where he developed deep learning, data fusion, and contrastive learning approaches to predict clinical outcomes from high-resolution physiological and clinical data. He also evaluated computational drug discovery startups at Takeda Ventures.

Erik received an MD from Emory University and a PhD in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Statistics from Georgia Institute of Technology where he published and patented signal processing and ML methods. He also co-founded Forge Health, a non-profit that provided startups with funding, mentors, and assistance starting clinical pilots at Emory Healthcare and the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Originally from Los Angeles, Erik graduated from UCLA with a B.S. (honors) in Bioengineering, and currently serves on the Department of Bioengineering's Alumni Advisory Board.
