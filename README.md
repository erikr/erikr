### About
Erik was an early employee at Prometheus Biosciences (`$RXDX`), a biotech company bringing precision medicine to autoimmune disease. At Prometheus, he was the founding Director of the Data Science & Engineering (DSE) team. DSE curated multimodal data assets, built bioinformatics pipelines, and implemented machine learning (ML) methods to enable therapeutic target validation and companion diagnostic development. These efforts supported a successful phase 2 clinical trial in ulcerative colitis, a new IND for a novel drug candidate targeting CD30L, and various indication expansion activities.

Before Prometheus, Erik completed postdoctoral training at Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and the Broad Institute where he worked on deep learning approaches to predict cardiovascular disease outcomes from physiological data. He also evaluated data science and drug discovery startups at Takeda Ventures.

Erik received an MD from Emory University and a PhD in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Statistics from Georgia Institute of Technology where he published and patented signal processing and ML methods. He also co-founded Forge Health, a non-profit that provided startups with funding, mentors, and assistance starting clinical pilots at Emory Healthcare and the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Originally from Los Angeles, Erik received a B.S. in Bioengineering with focuses in Computer Science and Chemical Engineering from UCLA.

In his free time Erik enjoys pickleball, bouldering, and traveling.
