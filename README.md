### About
Erik was an early employee at Prometheus Biosciences (`$RXDX`), a biotech company bringing precision medicine to autoimmune disease. At Prometheus, he built and led the Data Science & Engineering (DSE) team. DSE developed curated data assets, bioinformatics pipelines, and machine learning methods to enable therapeutic discovery and companion diagnostic development.

Before Prometheus, Erik completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Mass General, MIT, and the Broad Institute where he developed deep learning approaches to phenotype patients using high-resolution physiological data. He also evaluated early-stage investment opportunities at Takeda Ventures with a focus on data science and drug discovery.

Erik received an MD from Emory University and a PhD in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Statistics from Georgia Institute of Technology where he published and patented signal processing and machine learning methods applied to physiological data. He also co-founded Forge Health, a non-profit that provided startups with funding, mentors, and assistance starting clinical pilots at Emory Healthcare and the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Originally from Los Angeles, Erik received a B.S. in Bioengineering with focuses in Computer Science and Chemical Engineering from UCLA.

In his free time Erik enjoys pickleball, bouldering, and traveling.
