### About
Erik leads Data Science & Engineering at [Prometheus Biosciences](https://www.prometheusbiosciences.com). His team of data scientists and software engineers develops Prometheus 360, a platform of curated data and computational tools that accelerates target discovery, target validation, and companion diagnostic development. Bioinformatics capabilities include genetic target discovery, bulk and single cell RNA-Seq, and machine learning to identify subgroups of patients who respond to therapeutic candidates.

Before joining Prometheus, Erik completed postdoctoral training at MGH, MIT, and the Broad Institute developing deep learning approaches to phenotype patients using high-resolution physiological time series data.  He also evaluated early-stage investment opportunities at Takeda Ventures with a focus on data science and drug discovery.

Erik received an MD from Emory University and a PhD in Biomedical Engineering and Statistics from Georgia Institute of Technology where he published and patented signal processing and machine learning methods applied to physiological data. He also co-founded Forge Health, a non-profit that provided startups with funding, mentors, and assistance starting clinical pilots at Emory Healthcare and the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Erik received his undergraduate degree from UCLA in bioengineering with focuses in computer science and chemical engineering.
