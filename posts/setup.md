This was my setup in grad school. Note all actual compute was performed on a much more powerful workstation.

## Hardware

![setup](/assets/setup.jpg)

+ [13" Macbook Pro without touchbar](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/): I tried the touch bar but it was more expensive and less useful than tactile keys.
+ [Dell Ultrasharp U2415 24" monitor](http://www.amazon.com/Dell-Ultrasharp-U2415-24-Inch-LED-Lit/dp/B00NZTKOQI?ie=UTF8&colid=3VQOYNDOY25H&coliid=I39YUWPZNQ483D&psc=1&ref_=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl) plus a cheap extra HP display I found in the office.
+ [Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard and mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Ergonomic-Wireless-Desktop-Keyboard/dp/B00CYX54C0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1500304320&sr=8-1&keywords=microsoft+ergonomic+keyboard+and+mouse): feels great even after coding and writing for hours.
+ [Dual-screen wallpapers from TwelveSouth](https://www.twelvesouth.com/wallpaper): I love Hawaii!
+ [Bose QuietComfort 35 Wireless Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B01E3SNO1G): great for working in an open office space, and plane flights.
+ [SteelSeries Airtouch standing desk](https://www.wayfair.com/Steelcase-Airtouch%E2%84%A2-Standing-Desk-SCA1146.html).

Everything goes into my Macbook via two USB-C cables. I route all my USB-A peripherals through the Dell monitor, which routes both USB and video to a USB-C hub that also has ethernet and power for the Mac. The hub connects to my Mac via a USB-C extension cable so I can keep the mess hidden under the desk. I use an HDMI to USB-C cable (in red) to connect my Mac to the second display.

Tip from [@mattmight](http://www.twitter.com/mattmight):

> Buy multiple laptop chargers. Leave one at your office, one at home, etc. It can actually [make economic sense](http://matt.might.net/articles/artificial-scarcity/) if the cost of packing up your charger exceeds the cost of buying another one.

## Software

+ [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/); much better than the default macOS terminal.
+ [Mathias Bynen's dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).
+ [Vim](http://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-vim/) to write code; steep learning curve but useful.
+ [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme.
+ [Night Shift](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207513) active 24/7 to reduce eye strain.
+ [Mendeley](http://mendeley.com/) to manage research papers and references. Export `.bib` files when you write papers, sync your PDFs to the cloud, read and annotate PDFs on any device, and create shared folders with your team.
+ [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) for writing papers in $$\LaTeX{}$$.
