title: New role at Prometheus
---

I am excited to announce my new role as Director of Data Science and Engineering at [Prometheus Biosciences](https://www.prometheusbiosciences.com) -- a rocketship of a life science startup in San Diego that seeks to develop novel therapeutics and companion diagnostics for autoimmune disease. My team will develop and execute the road map for how the company organizes and analyzes clinical and multi-omics data, starting with unfettered access to one the richest GI biobanks in the world.

The timing is fortuitious -- a close friend from medical school (who actually recruited me to this role) just joined Prometheus as Chief of Staff to the CEO. The company raised $130M, has collaborations and data from several academic medical centers, and needs modern technology infrastructure to enable an ambitious vision of precision medicine.

Prometheus has many experts in immunology, GI, genomics, etc. Working with these scientists and clinicians will expand my background from physiological signal processing and ML applied to cardiovascular disease and critical care. I bring a distinct skillset to this company -- perspectives in how to organize data, code, and work around complex scientific challenges.

I am pumped for this opportunity to grow as a leader and positively impact the lives of patients using data and technology. The team at Prometheus is fantastic and has tremendous ambition and depth. It also can be interesting to take some risks with one's career.

Over the next few weeks, I will conclude work at MGH and MIT and transition to this new role. I am grateful to my advisors (Aaron Aguirre, Collin Stultz, and Puneet Batra), my colleagues, and our collaborators whose mentorship has prepared me for this next step. I will continue to be based in Boston, and plan on recruiting the best talent from around the country to my remote-first team.

If you are working in software engineering, product, design, data science / ML, genomics, immunology, companion diagnostics, etc. and want to make an impact, let's talk!
