I completed my postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Systems Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital, Computational Cardiovascular Research Group at MIT, and Machine Learning for Health initiative at the Broad Institute. I curated multimodal biomedical data, developed ML infrastructure, and trained models to predict clinical outcomes from EMR data and ECGs.

I obtained my PhD in Biomedical Engineering and Statistics at Georgia Tech where I worked on signal processing and ML applied to physiological and behavioral data. We patented and licensed some of this work.

Earlier, I studied Bioengineering at UCLA, after starting in computer science, and minored in chemical engineering. I developed cellularized fibrin hydrogels for dermal wound healing, nanoparticles for imaging cells, and computational diffusion-reaction models of oxygen transport and cell growth.
